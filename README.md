ESKOM PREDICT
Creating a set of function that describe useful metrics in ESKOM data. Functions to be used in numeric and text data, functions which take in a list or a pandas dataframe and returns a dictonary or a list. The other functions will take in a list or as a dataframe and returns a list or pandas dataframe.

PREREQUISITES
[Python],[Pandas],[Numpy]

INSTALLING PYTHON:
step 1
Open a browser window and navigate to the Download page for Windows at python.org.
Underneath the heading at the top that says Python Releases for Windows, click on the link for the Latest Python 3 Release - Python 3.x.x. (As of this writing, the latest is Python 3.6.5.)
Scroll to the bottom and select either Windows x86-64 executable installer for 64-bit or Windows x86 executable installer for 32-bit. (See below.
step 2
Run the installer,Once you have chosen and downloaded an installer, simply run it by double-clicking on the downloaded file.Then just click Install Now. That should be all there is to it. A few minutes later you should have a working Python 3 installation on your system.

INSTALLING PANDAS USING PIP:
step 1
First head over to https://www.python.org and click on Downloads on the Navigation bar.
step2
Be sure to download the latest version of the Python. Version 3.7.3, in this case.
step 3
On running the downloaded installer, you will get this window. Click on ‘Install Now’.
step 4
After finishing the installation, it is recommended to choose the option to disable path length to avoid any problems with your Python installation.
step 5
Now that Python is installed, you should head over to our terminal or command prompt from where you can install Pandas. So go to your search bar on your desktop and search for cmd. An application called Command prompt should show up. Click to start it.
step 6
Type in the command “pip install manager”. Pip is a package install manager for Python and it is installed alongside the new Python distributions.
step 7
Wait for the downloads to be over and once it is done you will be able to run Pandas inside your Python programs on Windows.

INSTALLING NUMPY:
You can download the required version of python from python.org. Once python is installed successfully, open command prompt and use pip to install numpy.

INSTALLING PACKAGE
To install the package, github and visual studio code need to be installed already.
1. Open visual studio editor 
2. Open a new folder named 'My Package'
3. Inside My Package, create a folder called 'group_6_module'
4. Inside group_6_module, create files named __init__.py and group_6_module.py
5. All the 7 predict functions are in group_6.py file
